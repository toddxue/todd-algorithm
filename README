Some algorithm codes from Todd Xue

    Thoughts about source codes structure

      1. The root directory contains the source codes/Makefile/README
      2. There will be only 1 Makefile for the whole project, e.g.
         no sub directory Makefile
      3. Testing take Perl's TAP protocol, ref perldoc Test::Harness
         e.g.
	     max.cpp is tested by t/max/max.t.cpp,
	     if test is too complicated, t/max/max.perl.t or (...ruby.t)
	     will be added.
	 To let prove run non perl script, `--exec "" ' is added into .proverc
	     e.g. t/max/max.t here is a binary
